# libpocket — C++11 Data Structures & Algorithms Library

`libpocket` is implementation of stuff found in Lee Wittenberg's [Data
Structures and Algorithms in C++: Pocket Primer](1) (hence the name) — an
exercise aimed at refreshing C++, CMake, TDD, and, well, data structures and
algorithms.

_**Safety warning**: do not use this in production unless you really have to._
